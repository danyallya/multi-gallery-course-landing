# Multi Gallery Course Landing

A clean and responsive multi-page landing website featuring multiple gallery styles for courses and general media. Built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **jQuery**, this project is ideal for educational platforms, academies, or training centers.

## 📸 Overview
This project includes **three distinct pages** designed to showcase:
- General information about the academy or course (`index.html`)
- A classic **media gallery** (`gallery.html`)
- A **course-focused gallery layout** (`course-gallery.html`) — perfect for highlighting different classes, instructors, or topics

All assets are neatly organized and built without frameworks for easy customization.

## 📋 Pages Included
- `index.html` – Main homepage with overview and key details
- `gallery.html` – Classic media/image gallery page
- `course-gallery.html` – Gallery-style course listing

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Semantic markup and accessibility
- **CSS3** – Responsive layout, animations, Flexbox/Grid
- **jQuery** – Interactive elements like filters, modal popups

> ⚠️ Note: This is a frontend-only project. Can be easily extended with backend integration.
